=======

Why ezyPEzy?
------------
ezyPEzy was whimsically selected by our research group to be the name of our project, coining "ezy" as the ease with which measurements can be taken, and "PE" representing the type of measurements taken (polarization-electric field hysteresis curves)
Cheesy, we know :)

Warning!
--------
This code was written to be functional, not optimized. It was heavily rushed and may be highly unstable.

What is it?
-----------
ezyPEzy is a project created by Kevin Chen, with the invaluable help of Matthew Dawber's lab at SUNY Stony Brook University. It is a proof-of-concept low-cost ferroelectric analyzer that gathers preliminary screening data for electrical characteristics of thin-film ferroelectric capacitors. It is built on the Arduino chipkit, and utilizes a circuit to send and receive a signal to and from the sample. The code base also includes a Python GUI for interacting with the Arduino. It is capable of sending commands to request data buffered on the Arduino, graphing that data, and saving it as a vector or a csv file.

To-do list
----------
* Refurbish legacy code
* Enable restarting of Arduino data collection from GUI
* Stabilize data collection process
* Add calibration

How does it work?
-----------------
The complete circuit can be viewed in the included paper.

Accolades
---------
ezyPEzy was named a 2013 Intel STS finalist project.
